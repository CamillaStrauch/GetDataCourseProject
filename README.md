# Get and Clean Data Project
This repo contains scripts to conclude the Class project for Coursera class on Getting and Cleaning data using R

# Short description
This repo contains R code that downloads, reads, and summarizes a dataset.
For details on the dataset and tidy data it outputs (i.e. the `./tidy.txt` file), see the `CodeBook.md` file.

# Running script
The script `run_analysis.R` will download the dataset, unzip it, read it in, and output the tidy dataset. 
The script will read in the necessary data and output the tidy dataset in the file `./tidy_data.txt
